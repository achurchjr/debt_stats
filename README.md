# Debt Stats

## Summary

Each year, the world generates trillions of dollars in debt. To low and middle-income countries, these monetary flows are a critical source of credit to finance and complete various projects to develop and diversify their economies. In 2019 alone, the 120 low and middle-income countries around the globe generated $8.1 trillion of external debt. Every year, The World Bank collects data from these low and middle-income countries and publishes them in International Debt Statistics. In 2020, The World Bank - due to global financial shocks from COVID-19 and combined with a renewed emphasis on debt transparency - for the first time released individual creditor countries within International Debt Statistics. Users can view the interactive map at the bottom of the page to visualize these newly released creditor country breakdowns. Previously, such data was only available at a generalized ‘creditor region’ level. Such a release provides a tremendous level of granularity, which economic and public policy analysts can use to examine relationships between the 120 low and middle-income countries of the world.

As new creditors emerge around the world, these stocks of external debt will continue to rise - as they have in the last decade. For example, China - itself a middle-income country - has greatly increased its lending to low and middle-income countries in the last 20 years. Generated by Tableau, the interactive charts and maps in this report will examine how the creditor profiles of two regions - Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa - have changed in the last 20 years.


### Relationship between debt distress and exports

Using this interactive map, users can view a generated ‘debt distress rating’ for a selection of low and middle-income countries. One can examine the relationship between a country’s level of indebtedness, and see how it relates to their diversity of export categories. Specifically, this rating compares the ratio at which a country uses export revenues to pay off its public external debt. Typically, if a country experiences declining export revenues and increasing levels of external debt, it is headed towards an unsustainable debt profile. In addition to this, some scholars assert that commodity-dependent economies over-borrow in times of high export revenues, leading to burdensome external debt in later years (Edo, 2020) For example, if you click on Brazil, you can easily see a diversity of export categories such as fuels, food, and agricultural products. Governments will typically use a fraction of these export revenues to pay off loans owed to other countries. Using the bar chart on the right, one can examine a country’s history of export diversification for the last 20 years.
